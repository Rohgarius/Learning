    <div class="box">
        <p class="intro-txt">A <span class="bold">dwarf</span> (pl. dwarfs or dwarves) is a type of supernatural being in Germanic folklore, 
            including mythology. Accounts of dwarfs vary significantly throughout history; however,
             they are commonly, but not exclusively, presented as living in mountains or stones and
             being skilled craftsmen. In early literary sources, only males are explicitly referred to 
             as dwarfs, although they are described as having sisters and daughters, while both male and 
             female dwarfs feature in later saga literature and folklore. Dwarfs are sometimes described 
             as short; however, scholars have noted that this is neither explicit nor of relevance to their
              roles in the earliest sources.</p>

        <p>IDwarfs continue to feature in modern popular culture such as in the works of J.R.R. Tolkien 
            and Terry Pratchett, where they are often, but not exclusively, presented as distinct 
            from elves.</p>
